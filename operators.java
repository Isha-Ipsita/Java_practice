/* types of operators
 * symbols that tell compiler to perform operations 
 * sum=a+b parts of expression - a, b- operands , +-operator
 * types-
 * arithmetic -binary , unary    --turnary
 * relational
 * logical
 * bit wise 
 * 
 * 
 * ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
 * maths basics 
 * BINARY                 UNARY
 *  +                    ++
 * _                     --
 * *
 * /
 * % (modulo-gives remainder)
 * 2 operands           1 operand 
 * 
 * unary operators
 * a=a+1         a++ or ++a  increment operator                     2 types- pre -change val and then use 
 *                                                                        and post -use value and then change 
 * a=a-1           a-- or --a decrement operator   
 * 
 * Relational operators 
 * a=b , b value is stores in a , is an assignment operator 
 * ==   ans in boolean 
 * !=  not equalto 
 * >
 * <
 * >=
 * <=
 * 
 * 
 * Ternary operators
 * 3 operands -> if else combination
 * variable=condition? statement1:statemet2;
 *
